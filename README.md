# AirBnb Calgary Listings
Here we implemented the AirBnb Calgary listings and made comparision of between different boroughs and different listings based on 
the price. The colour range is from grey to red representing low to high price range. The mouse over function give us the informations of that
particular borough or listings. 

To implement it at first we will have to download the whole folder and using terminal we will have to set the current destination of the
to the folder. Then we will have to use command : python -m http.server 8888  in the terminal and in the webbrowser we will have to
go to the address: localhost:8888 and click on the file "AirBnbCalgary(V9).html". Then we will be able to see the implementation.
